#The script conway.py runs Conway's Game of Life              
#Requirements: Python 2.6 and Tcl/Tk (Major operating systems meet these reqs).   
#Run the script from a command line, and provide the board dimensions.         
#Example: 'python conway.py 15 15'                                             
#A 'Start' button will appear in the upper left corner of your screen. 

The game creates random initial conditions. It can be launched from a command line by navigating to the directory containing conway.py and and running: 

   python conway.py  

The default board size is 15x15, but bigger boards may be created by passing width and length as arguments:

   python conway.py 15 20

Boards larger than 20x20 are not recommended, since the GUI begins to slow down.
